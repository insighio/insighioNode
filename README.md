# insighioNode

The core libraries, utilities and application scenario for [insigh.io nodes](https://insigh.io/iot-nodes/) to operate with [insigh.io console](https://console.insigh.io)

The project is based on MicroPython and tested on Pycom and ESP32 devices.

# API reference

A complete description of all the supported APIs along with tutorials can be found in [insigh.io docs](https://docs.insigh.io).

# Install

## Release binaries

Download the [latest release binary](https://github.com/insighio/insighioNode/releases) and extract localy. 
The archive can be found in the release assets and its file name is:
 * insighio-__\<release-version\>__-__\<commit-hash\>__-__\<board-version\>__.tar.gz
 * example: _insighio-v2.2.0-f49e354-esp32s3.tar.gz_
 
The archive includes the required binaries including a flash script. 

The flash script uses [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) to download the binaries on the board, so before proceeding make sure esptool is installed.

```bash
# 1) power on device into download mode
#    hold "boot" button and click "reset" button. Ready to download the binary

# 2) donwload binaries

bash flash_usb0.sh
#   or
# bash flash.sh /dev/ttyUSB0

# 3) click "reset" button once and wait till the initialization finishes. 
#
# 4) When ready the device will light up the RGB led. 
#       - If it is the first boot, it will directly enter configuration mode. 
#       - If the device is already configured, it will continue the normal execution circle.

```
For extended configuration details, advice [insigh.io documentation](https://docs.insigh.io/gettingstarted/configuration/)

## From source code
First thing first, clone repository and get all required submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/insighio/insighioNode

cd insighioNode
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Code upload via [Pymakr](https://pycom.io/products/supported-networks/pymakr/)

1. Install Pymakr addon for VSCode or Atom
1. Open project folder `insighioNode/insighioNode`
1. Upload the code

### Code upload via [ampy](https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy)

[ampy](https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy) is a command line tool to operate on micropython devices. To upload the code follow the commands:

```bash
cd insighioNode/insighioNode

# for ESP32 devices
ROOT_PATH=""
# for Pycom devices
#ROOT_PATH="/flash"

ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 put apps $ROOT_PATH/apps
ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 put boot.py $ROOT_PATH/boot.py
ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 put lib $ROOT_PATH/lib
ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 put main.py $ROOT_PATH/main.py
ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 put web_server.py $ROOT_PATH/web_server.py
ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 put www $ROOT_PATH/www
```

# Configure

The configuration of the device operation, security keys, network connection etc. can be done through the implemented [Web UI configuration wizard](https://docs.insigh.io/gettingstarted/configuration/).

After following the [Getting Started](https://docs.insigh.io/gettingstarted/) steps, the device will be ready to measure and upload!
